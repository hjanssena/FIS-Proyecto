## General skills

### Organization and Planning:

Creating a software system for scheduling appointments and keeping track of services involves meticulous planning. Developers must define workflows, set deadlines and priorities, and allocate resources efficiently.

### Data and Records Management:

The software system will perform accurate data and record management. Developers must design a database that stores customer, appointment, and service information. This will promote competition in data and records management.

### Human resources management:

If you work as a team in the development of the system, it is essential to properly manage human resources. Team members must assign roles and responsibilities, communicate fluidly, and coordinate their efforts to achieve project objectives.

### Effective Communication and Transparency:

Effective communication is essential to the success of the project. Team members must maintain open and constant communication to ensure that everyone is aware of progress, problems and solutions. Additionally, using tools like Github to document the project promotes transparency by allowing all team members and stakeholders to see the progress and changes made.

### Capacity for teamwork:

Collaboration is essential in developing a software system. Encouraging good communication within the team and resolving conflicts in a constructive manner will promote the ability to work as a team and, therefore, the productivity of the group.

### Application of Knowledge and Skills:

Developers will apply their knowledge and technical skills to design and program the software system effectively, ensuring it meets user requirements and quality standards.

### Problem resolution:

As technical challenges or changing requirements arise, team members will need to identify problems and find solutions. This competition will be fostered as you address obstacles in system development.
