## General skills

The general skill in the development of a management system for an automotive mechanical workshop involve addressing different aspects of Software Engineering and its applications. Through specific activities, the development of essential skills in the Software Engineering professional can be promoted, such as:

**I. Evolution of Software Engineering:**
    - Analyzing the disciplinary evolution of Software Engineering provides crucial historical understanding. This activity promotes the professional's ability to contextualize their work in the mechanical workshop, adapting to technological and methodological changes over time.
    - Specific activities for the development of the management system include analyzing the needs of the mechanical workshop and adapting methods and techniques to these needs. This promotes the ability to customize solutions, demonstrating practical skills and a deep understanding of the workshop domain.

**II. Software Development Areas:**
    - The review of methods, techniques and good practices in the different phases of software development allows the professional to understand and apply updated concepts in the context of the mechanical workshop. This encourages adaptability and the ability to select best practices based on specific project needs.

**III. Software Life Cycle Models:**
    - Selecting the Software Life Cycle Model requires a careful evaluation of the characteristics of the team, client and problem. This activity promotes informed decision making, analytical skills, and adaptability to the specific circumstances of the machine shop.
    - By selecting an appropriate life cycle model, the ability to make decisions based on the specific context of the machine shop is fostered, strengthening the ability to evaluate and apply models according to project requirements.

**IV. Software Management Areas:**
    - Analyze methods, techniques and good practices in estimation, planning, monitoring, control, quality and software configuration processes imply fundamental management skills. Applying this knowledge to the development of the management system in the machine shop promotes efficiency and the ability to meet project objectives.

**V. Human Factors in Software Engineering:**
    - Identifying the human factors that affect the success or failure of software processes is essential for team management and effective interaction. Applying this knowledge in the context of the mechanical workshop promotes leadership, communication and conflict resolution skills.
    - Integrating human factors into system development promotes sensitivity to team dynamics and adaptability to individual needs, which contributes to a more effective and collaborative work environment.
   
By integrating these specific activities, the development of general skills increases while addressing system development. This guarantees a practical application of the principles of Software Engineering.
