## Criticism to the course

We consider that the course was carried out in a very good way, it promotes being proactive, applying what we see in the classroom and motivates us to investigate and learn more outside. That is something that should be maintained.

A criticism that arose from our team is that the explanation of the operation of the software management and quality control area was explained in a somewhat brief and dry way, it would be good to go a little more in depth with this topic.

Another case that could be improved is the topic of the SCRUM methodology, several speakers who came to present showed us with their way of applying it, which is important, but the theory became a little redundant after it was explained several times.

In general, the course was very useful to us and gave us the correct perspective of what it is to be a software engineer.
