# Workshop Control System

### Product description

There is a large number of systems designed for vehicle repair workshops, but they tend to be geared towards larger workshops such as dealerships, including features that do not apply to smaller operations. Likewise, many small businesses lack a system to support their operations because current software solutions are complex and often expensive.

The **product's objetive** is to create a system that allows a small vehicle repair business to control day-to-day operations and **start building a history that enables them to understand the state of their business over time. The system should be simple and streamline its functions to the most essential and important ones for the end user. It will also enable the user to view the indicators generated through system usage, such as vehicle intake and the types of jobs being processed.

The area covered in the workshop's process will be the part surrounding vehicle repair, from when it is received until it is delivered to the customer:

- **Vehicle Reception**: A service order must be created with customer and vehicle information, and the customer should be informed about the service that will be provided for their vehicle.

- **Repair Execution**: The agreed-upon work with the customer is performed. This includes steps like quoting parts and labor, customer authorization, and customer-related work.

- **Vehicle Delivery**: The customer is notified when the work is completed, and the vehicle is delivered with an explanation of the work done. This includes any warranties or guarantees offered by the workshop.

### Users

The primary user will be any automotive vehicle repair shop that receives no more than approximately 10 vehicles per day. The system functions will be designed for the operation of this type of business and the common structure of their teams.

As a secondary user, other repair businesses that are not related to vehicles but share a similar structure, such as air conditioning, computer, or cell phone repair shops, will also benefit from this system.

### Value proposition

As mentioned earlier, many current systems have an abundance of functions and demand a significant amount of time from the end user to keep up. The **value proposition** is a system that can be seamlessly integrated into the automotive business's operations without requiring drastic changes in how the workshop operates or extensive training. It will include the most important functions in a simple and concise manner, ensuring that the system serves as a helpful tool rather than a hindrance that consumes the user's time.

### Product evolution Second Delivery

The main idea of the product did not suffer many changes between the first and second installment, however, it was necessary to better define and refine the important aspects of it. Among the most relevant changes for our product were:

The data that will be saved for each service order was defined:

   - Service to be performed: Brief description of what the client requests, whether a diagnosis or a preventive service. It is an open field for the failure or service requested to be described in an understandable manner.

   - Type of service: It can be preventive or corrective, it will serve as a metric for the workshop to know what type of work it attends.

   - Reception date

   - Promised date and time: It is the time agreed with the client for the delivery of their vehicle.

The client and vehicle data were also defined, which are: Name and surname, address, telephone number, email, model and make of the vehicle, VIN and license plates.

In addition, a complete review of the requirements was made, resulting in a more compact and defined list, which considers the most important functions expected from the system.

### Product evolution Third Delivery

For the third installment, it was decided that the appointment function is not essential for a small workshop, since the daily vehicle flow they have is small (10 or less) and it will be an additional input function that will only increase the complexity of the system.  
  
Additionally, a requirement was specified to control the notifications that the application sends regarding status updates to the current open orders.
