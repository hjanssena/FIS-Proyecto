### Product evolution

The main idea of ​​the product did not suffer many changes between the first and second installment, however, it was necessary to better define and refine the important aspects of it. Among the most relevant changes for our product were:

The data that will be saved for each service order was defined:

   - Service to be performed: Brief description of what the client requests, whether a diagnosis or a preventive service. It is an open field for the failure or service requested to be described in an understandable manner.

   - Type of service: It can be preventive or corrective, it will serve as a metric for the workshop to know what type of work it attends.

   - Reception date

   - Promised date and time: It is the time agreed with the client for the delivery of their vehicle.

The client and vehicle data were also defined, which are: Name and surname, address, telephone number, email, model and make of the vehicle, VIN and license plates.

In addition, a complete review of the requirements was made, resulting in a more compact and defined list, which considers the most important functions expected from the system.

## Requirements

### Requirements evolution

During the course of this second delivery, we had to make numerous changes to both the functional and non-functional requirements. This was because we realized that the requirements we had defined in the first delivery were not well-defined. Moreover, many of them involved unnecessary implementations given the time constraints for this delivery. Consequently, we had to reevaluate the functional and non-functional requirements. 

We had to eliminate or modify many of the functional requirements, as we discovered that, when creating use cases, many of them were somewhat unnecessary. They didn't significantly contribute to the system's functionality, and we wouldn't be able to complete them by the final delivery deadline.Lastly, we narrowed down the non-functional requirements to those where compliance can be observed through the project's prototypes.

### Artifacts evolution

A series of use case specifications were developed where each functional requirement was described in terms of how a user would use it. Likewise, the use case diagram was improved from the one in the first delivery.

## Process

### About the process

For this second delivery, we have employed concepts from the incremental lifecycle, implementing them in small sprints while incorporating some features of the Agile SCRUM methodology. We can observe the incremental lifecycle in our project. For example, to complete the review and validation of requirements, we had to deliver an initial version. After receiving group feedback and making necessary adjustments, we had to update the requirements and create new artifacts. 

Regarding the use of the SCRUM Agile methodology, we did not utilize all its elements for our project, but only the features we considered relevant for our team's effective organization. The project was carried out in a series of sprints, which will be detailed later, as increments. However, daily team meetings were not conducted due to time constraints; instead, we opted for weekly meetings. We employed SCRUM roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team) for team organization.

## Design (UI/UX)

We created a user interface [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/QQ6kXK1QVzeRAKcwilSRc7/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ySZoxSK7i5XqvvHG-1), which was made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).
