This performance test consisted of applying management with estimation, quality, and management methods based on the software project that has been worked on throughout the semester.

Additionally, two infographics were produced summarizing what was done in this activity:

- [Link to the infographics in PDF]()

## Link to the first infographic

### Estimation Methods: 
1. **Regarding the project you are carrying out, make an estimate covering the required effort, associated costs (including salary allocation according to the functions and experience of each team member, indicate the reference used for salary calculation), and the necessary time. For this, use the function point technique based on the COSMIC method and apply it to a sprint of your choice.**

1. **Apply the WBS for user stories or use cases in a sprint of your choice and consider that work packages contain: idWBS, name, duration, estimated cost.**

3. **Present a Gantt chart of the planning and scheduling of activities carried out in a sprint of your choice (consider milestones, start and end dates for activities, as well as those responsible for each activity).**

### Configuration Management:

2. **Choose two artifacts generated as part of your project's process and conduct an audit of software configuration management, indicating whether configuration and versioning were carried out. Then, present a detailed report on this.**

## Design (UI/UX)

We created a user interface [Low fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/QQ6kXK1QVzeRAKcwilSRc7/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ySZoxSK7i5XqvvHG-1), which was made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

=======
With the low-fidelity prototype generated in the second delivery and once we had well-defined the flow that our software would have, we set out to generate a high-fidelity prototype in this third delivery. The main objective of creating this prototype was to showcase it to end-users. In this way, it would serve to conduct informal tests and gather important information for the development of PitSTOP.

[High Fidelity prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/QQ6kXK1QVzeRAKcwilSRc7/Untitled?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=98lkRxeclHcNMhCC-1) which was made using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

To verify that the constructed prototypes were correct, we had to ensure that they corresponded to the requirements we had defined for PitSTOP. If you want to learn more about this process, please check the following link.
