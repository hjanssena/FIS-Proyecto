[**Contribution metrics**]()
 
This performance test consisted of applying management with estimation, quality, and management methods based on the software project that has been worked on throughout the semester.

Additionally, two infographics were produced summarizing what was done in this activity:

### Estimation Methods: 
1. **Regarding the project you are carrying out, make an estimate covering the required effort, associated costs (including salary allocation according to the functions and experience of each team member, indicate the reference used for salary calculation), and the necessary time. For this, use the function point technique based on the COSMIC method and apply it to a sprint of your choice.**

3. **Present a Gantt chart of the planning and scheduling of activities carried out in a sprint of your choice (consider milestones, start and end dates for activities, as well as those responsible for each activity).**

### Software Quality Management:
1. **Compare the quality models proposed by McCall and Boehm, identify and list their essential characteristics, and reflect on which of these two models would be more suitable to apply in your software development project. Justify your choice.**

### Configuration Management:

2. **Choose two artifacts generated as part of your project's process and conduct an audit of software configuration management, indicating whether configuration and versioning were carried out. Then, present a detailed report on this.**
