### Problematic description
Many small workshops lack proper service management systems, primarily relying on paper agendas, notes, Excel, or, in the worst cases, having no organizational system at all. This leads to issues when providing good service and addressing customer complaints due to the absence of a robust service history management.

The **system's main objetive** is to enable a small vehicle repair business to have control over day-to-day operations and, at the same time, start building a history that allows them to understand the state of their business over time. The system should be simple and should streamline its functions to the most essential and important ones for the end user. Likewise, it will allow the user to view the indicators generated through system usage, such as vehicle intake and the types of jobs being processed.

### Target Users

The target user will be any workshop that receives no more than approximately 15 vehicles per day. The system functions will be designed for the operation of such businesses and the common structure of their equipment. Additionally, we can mention other repair businesses with similar organizational systems to that of an automotive workshop as secondary target users.

### Innovation
Many current organizational systems are designed for large vehicle repair businesses, offering numerous functions that require the end user to invest a significant amount of time to keep up with them. The system's value proposition is that it can be integrated into the automotive business's operations without the need for significant changes in the way the workshop operates or extensive training, making it simpler and more cost-effective for users. The most important functions will be included in a simple and concise manner so that the system serves as an aid rather than a hindrance that consumes the user's time.
