<center> <h1>Quality models proposed by McCall and Boehm</h1> </center>

During the progress of the project, the development team generated artifacts and configuration management of them to monitor their versions. Therefore, the team created a new baseline version per delivery to optimally represent the changes that the software system went through, so in total 3 approved versions of each configuration item were generated. Each version went through a monitoring and approval process by the development team, as well as the product owner in order to corroborate that the changes projected in each artifact reflect the characteristics of the system.

### Artifacts generated as part of the process in its most recent baseline version:
- Use Case Diagram (Version 3.0.0)
![Use Case Diagram (Version 3.0.0)]()

Throughout the development of the project, version control of the use case diagram was carried out with the objective of correctly reflecting the changes made to the requirements and showing in a clear and concrete way the interactions between users and the system. In total, three versions of the artifact were handled, the main differences of which stand out in the level of complexity of the diagram and the number of requirements shown in it.

The work team opted to create a baseline of the artifact for the first delivery, to do so it considered certain requirements of a “checklist” that each future version should meet in order to be incorporated into the repository and considered a new baseline:

  - Does the use case diagram completely and correctly reflect the functionalities detailed in the requirements table, without omitting or adding new ones?

  - Does the diagram correctly reflect the relationship between the different types of users of the system and the functionalities to which they will have access?

  - Has the version of the artifact been reviewed and accepted by the entire development team, as well as by the product owner?

- List of requirements (Version 3.0.0)
![List of requirements (Version 3.0.0)]()

Likewise, a configuration was presented to the requirements element to more accurately represent the scale of the project and specify more clearly the functionalities that the system must have. The artifact had 3 baselines that differ in the level of detail with which the requirements are described, as well as in the number of functionalities that the system will support and the quality of the writing of each of them.

For the artifact of the requirements table, version control of the baseline was managed using quality criteria for its implementation in the repository:

  - Has each requirement been reviewed and approved by the product owner?

  - Does the list of requirements correctly reflect the scale of the project, that is, does it show only the requirements that the final planned version of the system will have?

  - Does each requirement accurately, clearly and concretely describe a functionality of the system without leaving room for ambiguity?
