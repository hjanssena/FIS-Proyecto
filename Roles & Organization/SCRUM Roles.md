# SCRUM Roles

---

### What is the SCRUM Methodology?
Scrum is an agile framework through which people can address complex, adaptive problems while efficiently and creatively delivering products with maximum value. Thus, Scrum is a methodology that helps teams collaborate and achieve high-impact work. The Scrum methodology provides a set of values, roles, and guidelines to help your team focus on iteration and continuous improvement in complex projects. Additionally, you should know that in Scrum, small multidisciplinary teams work in customer-centric iterative cycles, creating a product incrementally.

The Scrum methodology is based on three pillars: events, roles, and artifacts. Furthermore, in Scrum, work is organized into sprints of a specified duration, typically set between one week and one month. Why can't sprints last more than one month? The reason is that increasing this period also increases the risk that both the requirements of what is being developed and the context might change. At the end of each sprint, an increment is generated and added to the rest of the developed product.

### Roles needed for the SCRUM methodology
Product OWNER: Responsible for setting priorities to maximize the value of the work. The product owner represents the company to the client. It should be a single person in charge, but they can also be part of the development team.
SCRUM master: The person who manages the tasks to be carried out by the work team, ensuring that all team members understand how to achieve the product's objectives.
Development team: Comprised of all the individuals responsible for executing the tasks established by the Product Owner, which were previously devised with the client.
Stakeholders: Those with a vested interest in the correct development of the process. These can be sponsors, clients, executives, or individuals external to the company who request work. They are responsible for ensuring that what they have requested is being effectively carried out.

### Advantages of Using the SCRUM

Scrum is more effective for teams that need to build and deliver frequently, whether they are traditional "products" like code or new features, or less common Scrum "products" like marketing campaigns or creative assets.

The benefits of Scrum are **agility and flexibility**. The Scrum process can help you enhance teamwork and achieve your goals more effectively. Additionally, Scrum teams always know exactly what they are working on, as they pull tasks from the product backlog and have a clear understanding of their objectives, ensuring that everyone is in sync with what "Done" means.
