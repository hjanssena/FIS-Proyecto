![Incremental Model](https://github.com/hjanssena/FIS-Proyecto/blob/d477df6f79f3043d7cbdc53d867a9d89e478cbe1/Assets/Incremental%20Model.jpg)

In the previous delivery, we mentioned that we used elements of the Agile SCRUM methodology; however, for this second delivery, we did not follow the same process because it was not proving to be efficient, and we had more time to complete the delivery. 

For this second delivery, we have employed concepts from the incremental lifecycle, implementing them in small sprints while incorporating some features of the Agile SCRUM methodology. We can observe the incremental lifecycle in our project. For example, to complete the review and validation of requirements, we had to deliver an initial version. After receiving group feedback and making necessary adjustments, we had to update the requirements and create new artifacts. 

Additionally, we prioritized each of the requirements to complete the prototype first and see if it worked. If there was any ambiguity in the requirement, we had to refine it and improve the existing prototype. We chose this development model because of the advantages it offers when working on a small system, allowing us to reduce risks during software development. As explained, this model makes it easier to determine the correctness of planned requirements for subsequent stages, and if we make a mistake in defining requirements, we don't have to start over; we can simply redefine or discard the requirement. 

Regarding the use of the SCRUM Agile methodology, we did not utilize all its elements for our project, but only the features we considered relevant for our team's effective organization. The project was carried out in a series of sprints, which will be detailed later, as increments. However, daily team meetings were not conducted due to time constraints; instead, we opted for weekly meetings. We employed SCRUM roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team) for team organization. We began with a Product Backlog to define tasks that needed to be completed, and we adapted the concept of "Sprint Retrospective" to be conducted without the need for an in-person meeting, while maintaining a feedback-oriented approach. 

## SPRINTS

![SCRUM Process](https://github.com/hjanssena/FIS-Proyecto/blob/b960e58c090ee9386f8f16977a65ff2d079bbebc/Assets/SCRUM%20Process.jpg)

### First Sprint
Size: The sprint duration was 4 days.  
Begin: 08/10/2023  
Ended: 12/10/2023 

**Planning**: 

The intended product for this sprint was a list containing a first draft of reviewed, adapted, and prioritized requirements in the new project scale, along with a complete translation of the project's repository into English. To achieve this, daily meetings were held within the team to reevaluate both functional and non-functional requirements, determining their relevance and feasibility. Additionally, two team members were assigned for the project translation. 

**Activities**: 

- Translate the repository from English to Spanish, including MD documents from the first delivery. 

- Begin documentation in the repository. 

- Review functional and non-functional requirements, followed by another prioritization of requirements using the MoSCoW method. 

**Responsibles**: 

- Hugo de Jesús Janssen Águilar 
- Capi Madera de Regil 
- José Pablo Martínez Martínez 
- Edwing Mauricio Molina Chim 

**Roles**: 

- **English Translators of the Repository**: José Pablo Martínez Martínez and Capi Madera De Regil 

- **Creation of the First Revised List of Requirements**: José Pablo Martínez 

**Results**: 

- Image of the modified first version of the requirements 

--- 

### Second Sprint
Size: The sprint duration was 1 week, equivalent to 7 days. 
Begin: 12/10/2023 
Ended: 19/10/2023 

**Planning**: 
As the product delivery for this sprint, a second list with the review of both functional and non-functional requirements already translated into English was planned, along with a first draft of the visually representative interfaces. To achieve this, the team agreed to create low to medium fidelity designs due to their ease of production. Only interfaces for requirements determined as essential were created, and the team utilized the Figma tool. Internal meetings were held to discuss the wording, specification, prioritization, and feasibility of this second requirements review. 

**Activities**: 
- Redefinition of functional and non-functional requirements. 
- Creation of a preliminary product design prototype in Figma (created with medium fidelity erroneously; it should have been created with low fidelity using wireframes). 

**Responsibles**: 
- Hugo de Jesús Janssen Águilar 
- Emiliano Contreras Gamboa 
- José Pablo Martínez Martínez 
- Edwing Mauricio Molina Chim 
  
**Roles**: 
- **Design of initial interfaces in Figma**: Hugo de Jesús Janssen Águilar 

- **Creation of the second revised list of requirements**: José Pablo Martínez Martínez 

**Results**: 
- Image of the second version of functional and non-functional requirements. 

- First prototype (medium fidelity) created in Figma. 
--- 

### Third Sprint

Size: The sprint duration was 1 week, equivalent to 7 days.  
Begin: 19/10/2023  
Ended: 26/10/2023


**Planning**: 
The team determined the sprint's objective to be the creation of a simplified list of requirements adapted to the new project scale and in accordance with the product owner's requests. Additionally, they planned the creation of use case diagrams that would allow the visualization of these requirements, aligning with the interfaces created in the previous sprint. To achieve this, a use case specification format outside the Scrum process was chosen due to its high fidelity to real-world examples of functional requirements. 

**Activities**: 
- Redefine requirements, eliminating those that are not necessary for the correct functionality of the software. 
- Create the UML use case diagram. 
- Develop specifications for each use case. 

**Responsibles**: 
- Hugo de Jesús Janssen Águilar 
- Emiliano Contreras Gamboa 
- José Pablo Martínez Martínez 
- Capi Madera de Regil 
  
**Roles**: 

- **Creation of the third revised list of requirements**: José Pablo Martínez Martínez 

- **Use Case Development**: Hugo de Jesús Janssen Águilar and Capi Madera De Regil 

- **Use Case Diagram Creation**: Hugo de Jesús Janssen Águilar 

**Results**: 
- PDF document with the latest version of functional and non-functional requirements. 
- UML use case diagram. 
- Document with specifications for each use case.

### Fourth Sprint
Size: The sprint duration was 6 days. 
Begin: 01/11/2023  
Ended: 05/11/2023 

**Planning**: 
For the objective of this fourth sprint, the team planned to create interface designs using the functional requirements established in the previous sprint. They decided to continue with a medium-fidelity design to avoid inconsistencies with what was done in the second sprint, all using the Figma tool. In this sprint, the team also created the material that will be sent as the second deliverable, with a focus on the changes that occurred from the previous delivery. Roles for video editors and project repository writers were planned and assigned to reflect the changes. 

**Activities**: 
- Create the final prototype of the system using Figma wireframes, without discarding the design ideas from the previous medium-fidelity prototype. 
- Document the activities in the project repository. 
- Create the video and product presentations, explaining the significant changes that the product underwent from the first delivery to this second one. 

**Responsibles**: 
- Alejandro Magdiel Duran Varela 
- Emiliano Contreras Gamboa 
- José Pablo Martínez Martínez 
- Capi Madera de Regil 
- Edwing Mauricio Molina Chim 
- Alejandro Magdiel Duran Varela 
- Sofía Reyes Rodríguez 
  
**Roles**: 

- **Final prototype design in Figma**: Hugo de Jesús Janssen Águilar 

- **Editor of the second delivery video**: Edwing Mauricio Molina Chim 

- **Script writing for the video**: Emiliano Contreras Gamboa 

- **Creation of visual content for the video**: Capi Madera de Regil 

**Results**: 

- Final low-fidelity prototype of the product, clearly showing at least two use cases. 
- Documentation in the project repository, including additional files that were necessary, such as a comparison document between the new and previous requirements. 
- Project presentation video. 
- Support slide presentations for the video. 

## ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Throughout the process, each member developed a role within the team, and the conditions were established that allowed for improved organization.
