## ORGANIZATION AND CHANGES

In the previous delivery, we mentioned that we used elements of the Agile SCRUM methodology; however, for this second delivery, we did not follow the same process because it was not proving to be efficient, and we had more time to complete the delivery. 

For this second delivery, we have employed concepts from the incremental lifecycle, implementing them in small sprints while incorporating some features of the Agile SCRUM methodology. We can observe the incremental lifecycle in our project. For example, to complete the review and validation of requirements, we had to deliver an initial version. After receiving group feedback and making necessary adjustments, we had to update the requirements and create new artifacts. 

Additionally, we prioritized each of the requirements to complete the prototype first and see if it worked. If there was any ambiguity in the requirement, we had to refine it and improve the existing prototype. We chose this development model because of the advantages it offers when working on a small system, allowing us to reduce risks during software development. As explained, this model makes it easier to determine the correctness of planned requirements for subsequent stages, and if we make a mistake in defining requirements, we don't have to start over; we can simply redefine or discard the requirement. 

Regarding the use of the SCRUM Agile methodology, we did not utilize all its elements for our project, but only the features we considered relevant for our team's effective organization. The project was carried out in a series of sprints, which will be detailed later, as increments. However, daily team meetings were not conducted due to time constraints; instead, we opted for weekly meetings. We employed SCRUM roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team) for team organization. We began with a Product Backlog to define tasks that needed to be completed, and we adapted the concept of "Sprint Retrospective" to be conducted without the need for an in-person meeting, while maintaining a feedback-oriented approach.
