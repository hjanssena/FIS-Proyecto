# PROCESS DESCRIPTION

## ORGANIZATION

![Incremental Model](https://github.com/hjanssena/FIS-Proyecto/blob/d477df6f79f3043d7cbdc53d867a9d89e478cbe1/Assets/Incremental%20Model.jpg)

During the project development and for each of the deliveries, we have been using an adapted version of the agile SCRUM methodology.

For this third delivery, we incorporated concepts from the incremental lifecycle, implementing them in small iterations while integrating some features of the agile SCRUM methodology. The incremental lifecycle is observable in our project. For example, during the prototype creation, there were functionalities that we considered implementing to enhance the software quality.

Additionally, we prioritized each requirement to complete the prototype first and verify its functionality. We chose this development model for its advantages in working on a small system, allowing us to reduce risks during software development. As explained, this model facilitates determining the correctness of planned requirements for subsequent stages, and if an error occurs in defining requirements, we don't have to start over; we can simply redefine or discard the requirement.

The project proceeded in a series of iterations, detailed later as increments. However, daily team meetings were not conducted due to time constraints; instead, we opted for weekly meetings. We utilized SCRUM roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team) for team organization. We began with a Product Backlog to define tasks that needed to be completed and adapted the concept of "Sprint Retrospective" to be conducted without the need for an in-person meeting, maintaining a feedback-oriented approach.

## ITERATIONS (SPRINTS)

![SCRUM Process](https://github.com/hjanssena/FIS-Proyecto/blob/b960e58c090ee9386f8f16977a65ff2d079bbebc/Assets/SCRUM%20Process.jpg)

### First Sprint
Start: 09/11/2023

**Planning**:

The goal for this sprint was to plan the distribution of tasks among all team members to maintain the weight-by-activity scheme and achieve an equitable distribution. We defined the estimation method to be used in the project, as well as the planning technique.

**Activities carried out**:

- Task distribution
- Definition of the estimation method
- Planning technique

### Second Sprint
Start: 16/10/2023

**Planning**:
As the product delivery for this sprint, we planned to finish the specifications of use cases, as well as the change history between the first, second, and third deliveries, the final artifact for measuring user test results.

**Activities carried out**:

- Use case diagram
- Drafting design correspondence
- Completing use case specifications
- Drafting the change history between the first, second, and third deliveries
- Defining users and innovation

### Third Sprint

Start: 23/11/2023

**Planning**:

The team determined that the sprint's goal would be the implementation of user tests, as well as the creation of the results report. Different resources for the video, audio recordings, presentation, and documentation in the GitHub repository were planned.

**Activities carried out**:

- Defining tasks for the delivery
- Final review of requirements
- Use case diagram and its corrections
- Completing use case specifications
- Creating high-fidelity prototypes of the project in Figma
- Drafting design correspondence
- Drafting the change history between the first, second, and third deliveries (product evolution)
- Defining users and innovation
- Conducting informal tests
- Analyzing and drafting results of informal tests
- Final process description
- Defining specific and general competencies for the third delivery
- Video script
- Creating a presentation for the video
- Recording the video script
- Recording the video script (pending)
- Video editing
