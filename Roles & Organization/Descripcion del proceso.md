# PROCESS DESCRIPTION

## ORGANIZATION


We essentially focus on equitable participation of all team members, distributing tasks according to each member's skills, creating an agile working approach where all team members participate, understand their responsibilities, and adhere to previously established deadlines.

First, we defined the activities to be carried out, guided by the evaluation rubric provided. Then, we reviewed it, and each team member took responsibility for the activity of their choice. The most crucial part of the process was defining the functional and non-functional requirements, using brainstorming sessions to gather initial ideas, which would be refined in subsequent meetings.

## ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES


Throughout the process, each member developed a role within the team, and the conditions were established that allowed for improved organization.

## AGILE METHODOLOGIES


We didn't fully use an **agile methodology**, but we did adopt some features that we found useful and that aligned well with our way of working in the SCRUM method, in this case, the quick meetings held every day, either in person or virtually, depending on the team's needs or conditions.
