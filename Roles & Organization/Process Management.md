# Process Management


### Activities
- Three main meetings (Brainstorming for functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and pre-delivery review):

- Agreements from the first meeting: Work is divided in GitHub projects, and a draft of the functional requirements is created.

- Agreements from the second meeting: A draft of the non-functional requirements is created, a project name is decided upon, and - deadlines for pending tasks are set.

- Agreements from the third meeting: The video dialogue is recorded, missing components are reviewed, and documentation is checked.

- Tasks were assigned using an Excel sheet in Office 365, where each team member selects which activity they are responsible for.
