# Process Management


### Activities
- The organization of the team was done through WhatsApp chat, quick meetings on Discord and meetings with the client in teams where we validated the requirements and redefined them.

- Tasks were assigned using an Excel sheet in Office 365, where each team member selects which activity they are responsible for.

- Quick meetings were held to review progress on assigned tasks.
