## Process Management

During the entire process of creating requirements, refining them and creating the prototype, due management was carried out on the process and for this, artifacts were created in which you can see how the development team has been organized, the first of which artifacts created is the individual contribution metric where you can see the task to be performed, those responsible for the task and the points assigned to each task in order to measure the weight of the task and know how much each member of the development team contributes. , the measurement is based on a technique from the Scrum Framework, which is the shirt size technique or in which a shirt size is assigned to the activity based on how heavy it is considered through team meetings. [Individual contribution metric.](https://github.com/hjanssena/FIS-Proyecto/tree/TerceraEntrega/Activities%20score)

Meetings were held with the team regularly and to refine details with each delivery of the project, using the Discord platform where the team presented ideas about what was missing before the delivery in order to have knowledge of how little or how much was missing and thus start with the refinement of tasks to be carried out in the next delivery and clear up doubts in the future and not have problems with the following deliveries.

We also had meetings with the Product Owner every week to show him the progress of the week and report it to him in writing so he knew how to continue with the development and what refinements were due, and it is in this way that we realized that the requirements They had to continue refining.

And finally, a tool that the GitHub platform had incorporated was used and it is one that allowed us to know the tasks that we had pending, which had already been delivered and which were still in process [Projects](https://github.com/hjanssena/FIS-Proyecto/projects), with this we managed to have an order during the first delivery, although the majority of the organization of this type was maintained by the WhatsApp application.
