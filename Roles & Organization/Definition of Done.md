## Definition of Done (DoD) for a Project Increment.  

The definition of quality elements associated with these tickets or requirements establishes the standards and criteria that must be met to consider the task completed. This includes aspects such as correct implementation of functionality, adequate test coverage, detailed documentation, and any other particular project requirements. This practice ensures that each software increment meets established expectations and quality standards, thus contributing to the delivery of a complete and reliable final product.  

For the last sprint of our project, these new requirements were determined:  

- All user acceptance tests, and all functionalities must meet the acceptance criteria defined at the beginning of the increment.  

- All safety measures defined in the safety requirements and standards of the mechanical workshop are implemented.  

- A performance evaluation is performed, and the increment must meet the performance requirements established on the defined devices.  

- All changes made during the increase must be properly documented.  

- The increment was reviewed and approved by the customer or Product Owner before being considered "done". Each requirement precisely, clearly and concretely describes a functionality of the system without leaving room for ambiguity.  

- The increase must meet the quality standards defined in the ticket for the requirement.
